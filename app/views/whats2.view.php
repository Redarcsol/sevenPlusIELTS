                                <p class="mb-40">In response to feedback from candidates, universities, and immigration authorities, IELTS has
made some minor adjustments to its scoring system. While the core band scoring system remains
the same, here are the key changes and clarifications to note:

								</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Enhanced Scoring Criteria for Speaking and Writing:</b> IELTS now uses more precise,
detailed criteria for scoring the Speaking and Writing components. This ensures that
candidates are evaluated more accurately based on their fluency, coherence, grammar,
vocabulary, and pronunciation.

	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Greater Weight for Task Response:</b> In Writing Task 2, the Task Response criterion
has become even more important. This means that providing a fully developed argument
with relevant examples is crucial for achieving higher band scores. It's important to
address all aspects of the task question thoroughly.

	</li>
	<li>
		<b>No Minimum Score for Each Section:</b> While individual band scores for each of the four
skills (Reading, Writing, Listening, and Speaking) are reported, IELTS now clarifies that
there is no minimum score requirement for any one section. Universities, institutions,
and visa authorities determine how they weight these scores based on the applicant's
needs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>More Detailed Feedback for Candidates:</b> IELTS is also introducing more detailed
feedback, especially for Writing and Speaking tests. This allows test-takers to better
understand the areas in which they need to improve for their future exams.
	</li>
