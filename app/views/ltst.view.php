                                <li><b>Practice Speaking Regularly:</b> The more you speak English, the better your fluency will become. Practice with friends, tutors, or even by recording yourself.</li>
                                <li><b>Answer Fully:</b> Don’t just give short answers. Expand on your responses with examples or explanations. For instance, if asked about your favorite food, explain why you like it and when you usually eat it.</li>
                                <li><b>Stay Calm and Confident:</b> Relax during the test. Take a deep breath before answering. The examiner is not testing your knowledge of the topics but your ability to speak fluently.
                                </li>
                                <li><b>Use Natural Language:</b> Avoid memorizing answers. Instead, focus on speaking naturally and clearly, using a variety of vocabulary and grammatical structures.</li>
                                <li><b>Listen Carefully:</b> Listen to the examiner's questions carefully, and make sure you fully understand them before answering. Don’t hesitate to ask for clarification if needed.</li>
